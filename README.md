# virtual-pet-kristenrjackson

Our virtual pet, Cheetah, is a flying monkey. She is a bit secretive about this talent, and will deny that she has this ability...unless you are persistent! ;)

Other than that, she is a normal, everyday monkey. She eats, sleeps, and plays, and will respond accordingly if these needs aren't met.

Lyna, Brandon, and Kristen worked on this project. Please review and grade the file uploaded to Kristen's GitHub repository for all three of us.
